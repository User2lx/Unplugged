          <h1>About the game</h1>
          <p>
            Minecraft is developed by Markus Persson. It's been under
            development since about May 10, 2009 Before Microsoft bought it. You
            can read the <a href="game/credits.html">full credits here</a>, or
            read about support and
            <a href="http://www.minecraft.net/support"
              >frequently asked questions here</a
            >.
          </p>

          <h2>Origins</h2>
          <p>
            I started Minecraft after playing some Infiniminer with a couple of
            people from TigSource. I realized that a game that simple yet that
            dynamic had a lot of potential to turn into a really great game, and
            kept coming up with things I wanted to change and stuff I wanted to
            add.
          </p>
          <p>
            I had recently quit my job as a game developer to be able to focus
            more on indie game dev during my free time, and I was looking for a
            new game to develop. I had a few ideas floating around, but most
            required really long development times.
          </p>
          <p>These two factors led to Minecraft.</p>
          <h2>Development and philosophy</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>Waterfall is dead, long live agile!</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            I've got a few plans and visions, but my only true design decision
            is to keep it fun and accessible. There's no design doc, but there
            are two lists; one for bugs, and one for features I want to add but
            think I might forget.
          </p>
          <p>
            I make sure to play the game a lot, and I've built my share of
            towers, and flooded my share of caves. If something ever doesn't
            feel fun, I'll remove it. I believe that I can combine enough fun,
            accessibility and building blocks for this game to be a huge melting
            pot of emergent gameplay.
          </p>
          <p>
            I strongly believe that all good stories have a conflict, and that
            all good games tell a good story regardless of if it's pre-written
            or emergent. Free building mode is fine and dandy, but for many
            people it will ultimately become boring once you've got it figured
            out. It's like playing a first person shooter in god mode, or giving
            yourself infinite funds in a strategy game.. a lack of challenge
            kills the fun.
          </p>
          <p>
            For survival mode, I'd rather make the game too difficult than too
            easy. That also means I'm going to have to include some way of
            winning the game (or some other climax) to prevent it becoming too
            exhausting.
          </p>
          <p>But if it's no fun, I'll redesign.</p>
          <h2>The future</h2>
          <p>
            I plan on developing Minecraft until it's a finished complete game,
            with a downloadable client (with fullscreen mode), custom key re
            mappings and possibly modding support.
          </p>
          <p>
            For as long as people enjoy and purchase the game, I will develop
            extensions after the game is done.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once sales start dying and a minimum time has passed, I will release
            the game source code as some kind of open source. I'm not very happy
            with the draconian nature of (L)GPL, nor do I believe the other
            licenses have much merit other than to boost the egos of the
            original authors, so I might just possibly release it all as public
            domain.
